## Howdy, howdy!

I am a recent Secure Computing graduate from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. While I was a student, I worked at the university's IT Security Office writing security documentation, managing the campus bug bounty program, and testing for security vulnerabilities. I love all things computer science-related, from red teaming to web development to systems architecture. I'm an attentive, hardworking person, but I also enjoy my hobbies, including playing guitar, reading, and playing video games.
