## Projects

### Poisonous Captions

Poisonous Captions is a Python tool I created to make it easier to poison unethical AI data collection of YouTube videos. It takes a video's SRT captions and a plaintext file of unrelated text, then combines both into ASS caption format and hides the unrelated text. If anyone tries to steal the video using YouTube's captions API (like many have been doing), then they'll get a mix of the video's captions and the poisonous user-supplied text.

**Skills:** Python, Git

### Homelab

I have created a humble homelab that runs a recursive DNS server, a personal media library, and a Docker environment for personal projects and educational experiments.

**Skills:** Docker, Linux, IP Networking, DNS, Server Hardening

****
### PintOS

I worked in a team of five to implement user programs, virtual memory, a file system, and TCP/IP networking functionality in PintOS, an instructional operating systems framework.

**Skills:** Operating Systems, Kernel Debugging, IP Networking, Kernel Programming, C (Programming Language), Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), Git

****
### Security Wargame Development

I developed a digital wargame in a team of nine using red-teaming skills. I researched, wrote, and presented a multidimensional security simulation based on the Texas ERCOT blackout and winter storms. Additionally, I co-led a team of 18 in a misinformation wargame as part of the wargame development process.

**Skills:** Attention to Detail, Wargaming, Software Project Management, Cross-functional Team Leadership, Microsoft Office, Technical Writing, Software Updates, Red Teaming, Git

### PhishGuard

PhishGuard is a Python tool that uses regular expressions to detect possible phishing attempts. It can recursively parse a directory of text files, including emails that have been encoded for obfuscation. False positives/negatives can vary based on user parameters. The final version of PhishGuard can detect 85% of phishing attempts with a 5% false positive rate, but improvements can be made with later work.PhishGuard is a Python tool that uses regex to detect possible phishing attempts.

### LGBTQ+ Housing Webapp

I developed a MEAN-stack, LGBTQ-focused housing search web application using scrum agile framework. I developed the concept, produced wireframes, and then implemented the backend while a partner handled the frontend.

**Skills:** Scrum, Agile Project Management, Angular Material, MongoDB, Angular, Web Development, Node.js, Express.js, Git

****
### Digital Security Planner

I led the frontend development team and worked with the backend team to create a web application prototype that would present readers with beginner-friendly cybersecurity resources and guides.

**Skills:** Cross-functional Team Leadership, Problem Solving, Web Development, Microsoft Office, Vue.js, Git

### Code for Nepal Service-Learning

I developed written and video documentation and a prototype website for a non-profit organization, Code for Nepal. The digital literacy documentation was provided to Code for Nepal for use in the organizations' educational efforts.
